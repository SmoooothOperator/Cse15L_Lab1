# The function of cd, ls, and cat
**cd no arg** <br>
In the home directory <br>
cd is short for change directory, since there is no argument, it does nothing. <br>

**cd path to directory** <br>
In the home directory <br>
since cd changes the directory, a path to the directory will change the current directory to the one in the path. <br>

**cd path to file** <br>
In the home directory <br>
since cd changes to a directory, a path to a file throws an error "not a directory" as a file is not a directory. <br>

**ls no arg** <br>
In the home directory <br>
ls is short for list, so list no argument would just list every file or directory under the current directory. <br>

**ls path to directory** <br>
In the home directory <br>
ls with an argument to directory, it just lists everything under that directory, which make sense. <br>

**ls path to file** <br>
In the home directory <br>
ls with an argument to file shows the file path itself, as there are no other files or directories under a file. <br>

**cat no argument** <br>
In the home directory <br>
cat with no argument shows a blank line, as cat would wait for user input. <br>

**cat path to directory** <br>
In the home directory <br>
cat will throw error, as the directory is not a file, and therefore cannot be read. <br>

**cat path to file** <br>
In the home directory <br>
cat will read the file and print it in the terminal, as thats the function of cat. <br>
